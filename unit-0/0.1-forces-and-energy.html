            <h1>force</h1>

            <p>
                A force is a push or pull. Pretty simple. If I pull on a crate, I am exerting a force on that crate. If molecule A repels (or "pushes") molecule B, molecule A exerts a force on molecule B. Mathematically, force can be positive or negative. According to the conventions of a bunch of old (dead) men, a positive force is repulsive, and a negative force is attractive. The units for force are Newtons, which may sound familar from the dude who came up with a few laws dealing with force. Here's one of them: \[F = ma\]
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>\(F =\) force</li>
                <li>\(m =\) mass</li>
                <li>\(a =\) acceleration</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You should know that the unit for mass is kilograms and that for acceleration is meters per second squared. If we multiply the two to get force, the unit of force is also kg m s<sup>-2</sup>, which is equivalent to Newtons.</p> 

            <p>
                The main type of force that we deal with in chemistry is the electrostatic force, or the force that exists between stationary charges. The electrostatic force between two point charges is expressed in Coulomb’s Law: \[F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\] 
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>\(F =\) force</li>
                <li>\(k = 9 \cdot 10^{9}\) N m<sup>2</sup> C<sup>-2</sup> \(=\) Coulomb's constant</li>
                <li>\(q_1 =\) charge of one point charge</li>
                <li>\(q_1 =\) charge of the other point charge</li>
                <li>\(r =\) distance between the two point charges</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This equation is pretty important and will be referenced a bunch of times later on. Memorize it. It tells us a few pretty important things that we can apply to atoms: 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>More charge = more force. Basically, using charges of higher magnitudes results in a force of a higher magnitude as well. Force and charge (of each point charge) is directly proportional.</li> 
                <li>Less distance = more force. In other words, the closer the two charges are, the greater the force between them is. We see that decreasing distance in the equation lowers the value of the denominator, resulting in a greater magnitude.</li>
                <li>Forces between two like-charges are repulsive. Let’s examine this using cases: 
                    <ul class="nested"> 
                        <li>Case 1: We have two positive charges. Multiplying \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) together results in a positive number since both are positive. Thus, force is also positive since neither Coulomb’s constant or the distance are negative.</li>
                        <li>Case 2: We have two negative charges. Multiplying \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) still results in a positive number because negative times negative is positive. Same as before, force is positive. 
                        </li> 
                    </ul>
                    This is pretty important as we’ll see in the next section. Remember it. 
                </li>
                <li>Forces between two unlike charges are attractive. This time when we multiply \(q_1\) by \(q_2\), we get a negative number, so force is negative as well. Also important. </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="center"> <! energy > 

            <h1>energy</h1>

            <p>
                Anyways, being forced to move on, energy is the ability to do work. Well what’s work? Work is the transfer of energy… Pretty self-referential. We’ll talk more about work later on, but for now, energy. How do we define energy without using work? A very simple definition is the capacity for change, especially in the context of chemistry. Let’s take gravity!
