            </h1>

            <p>
                I really don't like the way chemistry textbooks are written. They are 
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>expensive,</li>
                    <li>unstylistic,</li> 
                    <li>convoluted,</li>
                    <li>unstructured,</li>
                    <li>and incomplete.</li>
                </ul> 
            <p>
                Chemistry is hard. Why? Because learning materials lack coherence. What does this result in? Something that's hard to learn. This isn't made any better by the circular nature of chemistry. I am making this website to amend this. 
            </p>

            <p>
                How does my website fix this?
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This will be an ad-free website.</li>
                    <li>Hopefully you can also see my style here.</li>
                    <li>My style is (hopefully) conversational and easy-to-follow.</li>
                    <li>The structure of 
                </ul>
            <p>
                Moreover, I plan to write content in a so-called "Heming-way," filled with everything you need to know to understand chemistry (including areas where chemists disagree). I don't wish to present chemistry as just a collection of unrelated facts. I want to portray it as an argument where everything makes logical sense based on a few fundamental pillars. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In any case, welcome to this work-in-progress project.

            <p>
                Consider this as some online textbook or review book for chemistry. My goal is to work my way up the entire undergraduate sequence, starting with general/AP chemistry. I don't really wanna attach my name to this project for personal reasons. Feel free to call me infernious.
